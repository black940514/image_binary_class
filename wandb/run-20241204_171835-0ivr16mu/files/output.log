/var/folders/dr/74f443cx0ljg_9kz1_q1ylv80000gn/T/ipykernel_6275/2146829436.py:29: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
